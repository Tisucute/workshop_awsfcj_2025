#### 1. OpenWeather API
**OpenWeather API** is a service providing real-time weather data through RESTful endpoints. Users can retrieve information such as temperature, humidity, pressure, v.v. by sending HTTP requests and receiving data in JSON or XML format.

#### 2. Python Script
**Python** is a popular programming language, powerful in data processing. In this system, Python scripts are used to:

- Call APIs (e.g.: OpenWeather API) to retrieve data.

- Parse JSON data returned.

- Clean and normalize data (convert time zones, rename fields, v.v.).

- Export data to formats such as CSV, Parquet, or JSON.

- Push data to Amazon S3 for storage.

#### 3. Amazon S3
Amazon S3 is AWS’s object storage service, allowing data storage and retrieval with high durability and scalability. In this architecture, S3 is used to:

- Store raw data generated by Python scripts.

- Store DAG definition files for Airflow.

- Store requirements.txt files to manage dependencies for Airflow.

#### 4. AWS Glue
**AWS Glue** is AWS’s serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service, supporting automation of schema detection, data cleaning, transformation, and loading. Key components:

- **Glue Crawler**: Automatically scans data on S3, detects schema, and creates metadata tables in the Data Catalog.

- **Glue ETL Job**: Executes Scala or Python (Spark) code to process, transform data, and export results to S3 or Redshift.

#### 5. Amazon Redshift
**Amazon Redshift** is a cloud-based data warehouse service optimized for analytical queries on large datasets (OLAP). Redshift supports storing data using star/snowflake schema models, enabling execution of complex queries with high performance, suitable for BI tasks, data analytics.

#### 6. Apache Airflow (MWAA)
**Apache Airflow** is an open-source platform for scheduling, orchestrating, and monitoring complex workflows. On AWS, Airflow is provided as Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). Airflow uses DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to define data processing steps, supporting automation, retry, alert, and integration with multiple AWS services.

#### 7. Amazon QuickSight
**Amazon QuickSight** is a Business Intelligence (BI) service on AWS, supporting connections to multiple data sources such as Redshift, S3, v.v. QuickSight enables building interactive dashboards, charts, and reports using a drag-and-drop interface, supporting data analysis and visualization for business users.

#### 8. AWS CloudFormation, IAM, VPC, Secrets Manager
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as Code service, automating the deployment and management of AWS resources.

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manages access rights, authentication, and permissions for users/services.

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Creates isolated virtual networks on AWS, controls access, and secures resources.

- **Secrets Manager**: Securely stores, manages, and retrieves sensitive information (API keys, passwords, v.v.).
