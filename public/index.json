	"content": "Building an Automated Real-Time Data Processing and Visualization Architecture on AWS Author: Nguyễn Ngọc Anh Thư\nStudent ID: 22133059\nEmail: ngocanhthugialai@gmail.com\nUniversity: Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education (HCMUTE)\nOverview The project \u0026ldquo;Building an Automated Processing and Real-time Data Visualization Architecture on AWS\u0026rdquo; represents my dedication and effort to develop a comprehensive system that automates the collection, processing, and visualization of real-time data streams using Amazon Web Services (AWS). With the aim of meeting the increasing demand for timely analysis and decision-making based on the latest data, the system is designed to include key components: weather data collection from OpenWeather API using Python and storage in AWS S3; orchestration managed by Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA); data processing and transformation using AWS Glue; data storage in AWS Redshift warehouse; and finally, visualization of results through AWS QuickSight on an intuitive dashboard.\nInfrastructure deployment is implemented through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CloudFormation, ensuring consistency, automation, ease of management, and scalability for future resource changes or additions. Security policies and access management are also configured through AWS IAM and a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment to ensure system safety.\nI genuinely hope this report not only accurately reflects my efforts but also serves as a friendly, easy-to-understand resource for students new to AWS or modern development methodologies. Through this work, I aim to convey my enthusiasm and passion for technology and support students in gaining confidence as they embark on their AWS exploration and application journey.\nImplementation Timeline Data collection: 1 day Execution of steps: 2–3 hours (depending on familiarity with the tools) The data is only sufficient for analysis; collecting more may incur additional costs.\nThực hiện các thao tác: 2 - 3 tiếng (tùy vào độ quen thuộc với các công cụ) Contents Introduction Tools and Architecture Diagram Tools Used Architecture Diagram Steps for Automated ETL Process About Environment Files Infrastructure as Code Deployment Setting Variables, Creating Connections, and Uploading Environment ETL Execution Process Analysis and Visualization Analysis with AWS Redshift Visualization with AWS Quicksight Cleanup "

Click Users. Click on user Portfwd. Click Delete, then enter the user name Portfwd and click Delete to delete the user. Delete S3 bucket Access System Manager - Session Manager service management console.\nClick the Preferences tab. Click Edit. Scroll down. In the section S3 logging. Uncheck Enable to disable logging. Scroll down. Click Save. Go to S3 service management console\nClick on the S3 bucket we created for this lab. (Example: lab-fcj-bucket-0001 ) Click Empty. Enter permanently delete, then click Empty to proceed to delete the object in the bucket. Click Exit. After deleting all objects in the bucket, click Delete\nEnter the name of the S3 bucket, then click Delete bucket to proceed with deleting the S3 bucket. Delete VPC Endpoints Go to VPC service management console Click Endpoints. Select the 4 endpoints we created for the lab including SSM, SSMMESSAGES, EC2MESSAGES, S3GW. Click Actions. Click Delete VPC endpoints. In the confirm box, enter delete.\nClick Delete to proceed with deleting endpoints. Click the refresh icon, check that all endpoints have been deleted before proceeding to the next step.\nDelete VPC Go to VPC service management console\nClick Your VPCs. Click on Lab VPC. Click Actions. Click Delete VPC. In the confirm box, enter delete to confirm, click Delete to delete Lab VPC and related resources.\n"
